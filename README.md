# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game ✊✋✌️

## Introduction 🌟
The **Rock, Paper, Scissors** game is a classic hand game typically played between two people. In this project, we have created a digital version using Python, where the player competes against the computer. The game determines the winner based on the following rules:

- **Rock** crushes **Scissors** 🪨✂️
- **Scissors** cuts **Paper** ✂️📄
- **Paper** covers **Rock** 📄🪨

---

## Features 🚀
- **Single Player Mode:** Play against the computer.
- **Randomized Computer Choice:** Uses Python’s `random` module for the computer's move.
- **Score Tracking:** Keeps track of wins, losses, and draws.
- **Replay Option:** Allows you to play again without restarting the program.
- **Simple and Interactive Interface:** Easy to use and understand.
